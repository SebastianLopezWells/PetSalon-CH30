                    run and play. Our turfed outdoor play area has canopies, water toys, misters and plenty of water bowls
                    to keep our doggies cool on hot days. We also have 3 play yards in our cool basement level with
                    individual drains and air to keep everyone clean and happy. All yards are supervised by our Pack Leaders
                    to ensure that everyone is having fun and playing safe. We offer a variety of packages to fit your lifestyle.

                        the watchful eye of our Pack Leaders and trainers in order to attend daycare or boarding. During each test,
                        we will be measuring the dog's reaction to various elements such as, sound, touch, leash handling, separation
                        and play with humans and other dogs. Each dog will be categorized as “aggressive”, “stable”, or “confident”.
                        Upon passing, your dog is ready to participate in any of our dog services.
